* try to vectorize outer loop in hinge energy fast

* implement analytic gradient in hinge energy fast

* try to JIT/GPUify hinge energy fast with or without the outer vectorization.
seems like they would both help and are not mutually exclusive?

* ditch trimesh util, use open3d for opening/processing
